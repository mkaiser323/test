Fall 2015 Group Project for Software Engineering: CMP 408 at CUNY-Lehman College

<h2> Motivation </h2>

We were asked to create a group project amongst 2-3 classmates over an approximately two month period, starting first with
documentation and then with code creation only after all preliminary documents were approved by our professor/'customer.'
We chose an online art gallery, targeted at a nonprofit helping local artists display and get a profit from their electronic art.  
For more details, please see the documentation once posted or contact the authors.
